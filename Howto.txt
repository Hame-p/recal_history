
This folder contains the datasets and matlab code to analyze the ventriloquist bias and the immediate aftereffect in 
Kayser, Park & Heuer "The history of multisensory discrepancies affects the ventriloquism effect and the immediate aftereffect differentially".

The analysis was run in Matlab R2017a.


Datafiles (see Table 1):
-----------------------
DataExp1to10: Contains the data for Experiments 1-10 
DataExp11: The data for experiment 11

Main analysis routines:
----------------------
Analyze_historyeffect.m for Exps 1-10. 
Produces Figure 1b and 2.

Analyze_Exp11.m for Exp 11
Produces Figure 3.


local statistical routines (ensure these are accessible)
----------------------
The codes uses functions to compute glms and boostrap CIs. These are in /local/
